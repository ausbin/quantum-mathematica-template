# Quantum Mathematica Template

`qbase.nb` holds my template for doing quantum stuff in Wolfram Mathematica.
This was generated with Mathematica 13.0.0.0. Licensed [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0][2]
because some of this is based on [some great code by Rudolf Muradian][3], which
is under the same license.

Note: if you are a Georgia Tech student, you can download Mathematica for free
[from OIT here][1].
